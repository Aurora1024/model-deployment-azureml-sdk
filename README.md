# Deploying IMDB Reviews Classifier Model using Azure Machine Learning Service

In this GitHub repo, we learn how to deploy a keras model using Azure Machine Learning Service. We will use Microsoft Azure Machine Learning Service to deploy our model as a REST API end point to be consumed/invoked by any client application. [Azure Machine Learning SDK for Python](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/python/api/overview/azure/ml/intro?view=azure-ml-py) is used to work with Azure Machine Learning Service.

### What Model are we deploying?
